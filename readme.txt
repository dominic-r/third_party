===== third_party =====

Code pulled into the monorepo from external sources.
Kept separate to clearly distinguish it from my own code.

Reasons for importing:
- The project is small and easy to manage here.
- I want tighter control over the code for security or reliability.
- It's easier to keep track of changes this way.

Note: This directory is mirrored from GitLab 4x per day.
